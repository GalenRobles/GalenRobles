## 🚀 Currently Focused On

I am actively building skills in the mobile and backend ecosystems.

* **Mobile:** My primary focus is **Flutter**, building native applications for both iOS and Android.
* **Backend & BaaS:** Gaining experience with **Firebase** (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) and reinforcing my knowledge of **AdonisJS**.
* **Real-World Experience:** I am part of a team working as a **Freelance Flutter Developer** on a paid client project, applying these skills daily.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### Flutter Developer (Freelance)
* **Dates:** October 2025 – Present
* **Description:** Developing a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) from the ground up for a paying client. My role is integral, covering the full development lifecycle: from initial **UI/UX design** and prototyping, through **frontend development** of all views in Flutter, to implementing the **backend logic** with Firebase.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

My current core tech stack and supporting knowledge foundation:

* **Mobile (Core Focus):** Flutter, Dart
* **Backend & BaaS:** Firebase, Node.js, AdonisJS
* **Databases:** SQL (SQL Server, MySQL)
* **Web Development:** Previous experience in creating **responsive web frontends** (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* **Other:** Git, GitHub, Figma, Java, Arduino

## 🌱 Foundational Projects

These collaborative projects demonstrated my ability to specialize and manage complex technical integrations.

### 1. Backend for IoT System (AdonisJS, Android, Arduino)
* **Role:** Backend API Developer
* **Description:** My specialization was designing and developing a **RESTful API** using **AdonisJS (Node.js)**. The API served as the system's central "brain": it received data from **Arduino** sensors and served that data in real-time to a native **Android** app, connecting the hardware to the user interface.
* **Technologies:** `AdonisJS`, `Node.js`, `REST API`, `Android`, `Arduino`

### 2. Web Platform Development (Backend Integration Focus)
* **Role:** Frontend Development (API Consumption Focused)
* **Description:** My focus was on client-side architecture and managing the data flow. This experience allowed me to efficiently **consume a RESTful API** and work on a complete web application system, ensuring a responsive user interface.
* **Technologies:** `REST API Consumption`, `Frontend Development`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`

## 🎯 Career Goal

Actively seeking my first professional opportunity (internship, trainee, or junior role) as a **Flutter Mobile Developer** or in **Backend Development**. My goal is to apply my current experience and foundational knowledge within a team that values proactivity and continuous learning.
